        Hi, I'm Alex! I am a recent graduate from Augusta University with a degree in computer science.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I am looking to start a career, particularly in software engineering or information technology. I recently
        worked on a few projects, one was an Android app, another was a car rental
        system, and another project was a secure web application. I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team!
      </p>
  
      <h3>About Me</h3>
  
      <p>
        Born in Fort Sill, Oklahoma in 1999, into an Army family. I now live close to
        Augusta, Georgia due to its proximity to Fort Gordon as my father currently works
        there.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        My hobbies include playing video games and reading. These interests are what
        lead me into finding my calling and pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in
        Computer Science. I look forward to what the world has in store for me now that I have graudated!
      </p>
